To the honorable, pious, earnest, prudent, and wise gentlemen, the mayors, the appointed officials, and the ministers of God's Word assembled in the Synod of Zurich, our gracious lords and dear brothers in God, we, the preachers of the Gospel of the chapter of Wetzikon in the district of Grüningen, humbly offer grace and peace from God along with our dutiful obedience. 

Gracious lords and brothers, as in many past synods, various complaints have been brought forth concerning the convent members in Rüti, and since the following gracious and brotherly admonitions have had little effect, we presented before your esteemed wisdom and kindness a year ago the case of certain disorderly actions on their part. We humbly requested that you graciously intervene with the aforementioned men so that they might conduct themselves with more propriety, modesty, and decency in their lives and behavior—especially considering how graciously and abundantly they are provided for by our gracious lords from the church's funds. We also urged them to set a good example for the Church of God through their modest conduct and, in particular, to treat us, the ministers of the Word of God (who have always sought nothing but their friendship and goodwill), with more kindness, brotherliness, and goodwill.  

We hoped that, as a result, those who are daily attached to them with gifts, food, pastries, game, and other donations and friendships might be more receptive to the truth, more diligent in listening to the preaching, and more obedient to our lords’ mandates. We also hoped they would refrain from slander and attacks against us and our doctrine, which have caused much confusion among the people and stirred up animosity against us.  

However, our godly desire and the gracious admonition, as well as the fatherly warnings given by our gracious lords and the Synod through Mayor Walder and Master Heinrich Bullinger, have unfortunately had little effect. Indeed, we have perceived almost no improvement among the aforementioned men in Rüti. Instead, their behavior and that of their household continue as follows:  

1. Firstly, Bastion Hegnower, at the synod held a year ago, complained before some brothers, alleging that we are partial and inclined to complain only against them while sparing others their misdeeds. This accusation was particularly painful for us to bear. We therefore request that he and others be required to testify, both generally and individually, to what they know, in the hope that justice and honor may be properly served.  

2. A year ago, it was pointed out that these men had never assisted their preacher as deacons or helpers during the administration of the Lord’s Supper, to the extent that the preacher himself, along with the caretaker, was forced to distribute the bread and wine to the congregation. This is highly inappropriate, as such service belongs to those who receive their sustenance from the church and should therefore take joy in performing such duties, especially since they otherwise bring no benefit to the church. Yet, they have continued to neglect this duty to this day.  

3. Moreover, their attendance at church services is noticeably poor. They often arrive late, sometimes not until halfway through the sermon, and then gather with some of their followers behind the pulpit, beyond the walls of the choir. There, they move in and out during the sermon, coughing, clearing their throats, shuffling their feet, and sometimes even leaving before the sermon ends. Such negligence causes great offense among the common people, and some respectable individuals have complained that the noise and disruption from their coughing, throat-clearing, and wandering around disturb the preacher’s speech and make it hard to understand, thereby preventing them from properly meditating on the message.  

4. Herr Wolff Huber, the cellarer in Rüti, openly engages in violent behavior, frequently laying hands on people over minor matters and striking them. He has also come into conflict with pious and honorable citizens and neighbors over matters concerning the preacher, which is highly inappropriate for someone serving under a Christian government and receiving his sustenance from the church’s funds, which come from the labor of the poor. Since no punishment or penalty has ever followed his acts of violence, some laypeople now say, "The cellarer is free to beat people, and nothing happens to him. If I had that freedom, I would beat many as well." We refrain from mentioning how inclined these gentlemen are to overlook and quietly defend such misdeeds, whether committed by themselves or their followers.  

5. These men also make it a habit to host traveling pilgrims on their way to Einsiedeln, particularly certain Catholic priests and monks who are neither favorable to the city of Zurich nor to our faith. However, we hear little about them offering hospitality to poor exiles suffering for the sake of God's Word or showing kindness to preachers and those who uphold Zurich’s Christian mandates and ordinances. On the contrary, we frequently observe great hostility towards preachers traveling to Rüti, and even their household servants who show goodwill towards the ministers face difficulties because of it.  

6. It is well known how these men treated the pastor of Wald last year concerning the tithe from Scheidegg. While other officials have been punished with dishonor and loss of property for misappropriating tithes, these men have neither been questioned nor held accountable. As a result, the common people murmur, "If this is how tithes are handled, then I also know how I will act in the future."  

7. Our gracious lords of Zurich have reformed and improved all the institutions of the papacy and idolatry in Rüti, except for the disgraceful practice of openly harboring common prostitutes, who gather there in significant numbers and stay for extended periods, rarely or never leaving the monastery. These women are treated better and kept longer than the poor (who, according to our lords’ ordinances, should have precedence over immoral persons when receiving alms). At times, servants and other men with wives misuse these prostitutes, openly leading them through villages, to church fairs, and into taverns, causing great offense among our honest church members.  

8. There is serious doubt among all pious people as to whether these men live honorably and without offense, given the rampant immorality in Rüti. Furthermore, all secret entrances and illicit relationships are not only as common as they were under the papacy but have become even worse and more shameless. These men hold the keys to all doors, stairways, paths, and entrances, and some foolish people who associate with them are unable to keep quiet about what they have seen.  

9. The general disorder extends even to their servants, who, taking their masters as examples, show little discipline. Some of them have been found drunk, have insulted respectable people with blasphemy and slander, and have even harassed preachers outside their homes, sometimes in the presence of these very gentlemen.  

10. The common people suffer great hardship due to the ongoing wars and famines, yet these men keep a large number of dogs, which they lavishly feed with good, cooked food and bread from the monastery kitchen, while the poor sometimes go without.  

11. The people complain that church services in Rüti start too late because the gentlemen insist on keeping the old custom of delaying the bells until they have finished their meal. This is a burden on the working people, who are used to eating early and must return to their fields after the sermon. Some have even left without hearing the sermon, which raises concerns that church attendance will decline and faith will be weakened.  

Therefore, honorable lords and dear brothers, considering that we in the district of Grüningen are surrounded by those who bear ill will toward our doctrine and faith, and given the constant spread of scandalous rumors from Rüti that damage our faith, we humbly ask you, for the sake of God and His holy Word, to carefully consider the dangers and offenses arising from this situation. We seek your fatherly advice on how to address these ongoing corruptions so that we may remain faithful to God’s commandments.  

May Almighty God preserve your wisdom and love in steadfast Christian governance for the honor of His name and the good of the Church. With this hope, we remain your obedient and humble servants.
