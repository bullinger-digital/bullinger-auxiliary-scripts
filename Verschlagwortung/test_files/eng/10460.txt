I also wish to admonish you, most esteemed man, to carefully consider Capito's argument by which he believes the Arians can be easily refuted.

Firstly, he argues, if I am not mistaken, from creation. The Arians do not deny that all things were created through Christ, but they will not admit that Christ Himself created all things, nor does it necessarily follow: All things were created through Christ, therefore He is God the Creator.

Secondly, he thinks that the role of the accuser should be assigned to the Arians and that they should be pressed to prove this negationâ€”that Christ is not God.

Here, remember that it is very rare in legal practice to compel someone to prove a negation. It is more fair and just that we prove what we affirm and remain the accusers ourselves.

If we wish to cast the role of the accuser back onto the defendants, we may perhaps seem not to fully trust our own case and suspect it to be somewhat unstable.

I ask that, once read, you return these letters.

Farewell, and forgive me for burdening you with such unpolished writing.
