I cannot but thank you, most learned Heinrich, for having worked so diligently on my behalf.

However, if you had been more familiar with my education, which is indeed nonexistent, you would not have appointed me to this office.

Nevertheless, I do not doubt that God willed it so, since the matter was undertaken and concluded without my knowledge or consent. I shall therefore pray to Him to send me wisdom from His heavenly throne as an assistant so that I may be able to promote His glory.

As for the annual income, you wish to be informed. This benefice annually provides 25 bushels of wheat, 10 butts of wine, and 12 malters of oats â€” to speak plainly, 26 gold coins.

Farewell. In a few days, I shall be with you.

Dated on the 14th day before the Calends of April (March 19), 1537.
Heinrich Custor

To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, brother and lord.
