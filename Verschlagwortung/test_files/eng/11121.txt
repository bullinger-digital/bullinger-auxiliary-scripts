Further, concerning the matter raised in the template regarding me and others addressing you and other honorable people, should it be said that I have changed my opinion on the Lord's Supper, know that this is not true.

I believe and hold regarding the Holy Supper as it is articulated in the First Helvetic Confession of 1536 and in the writing addressed to Luther, formulated in Basel, and as has been taught until now in our churches. 

Namely, that the true, substantial, natural body of Christ is seated at the right hand of God and will not come physically until the last day. That the bread and wine are and remain bread and wine, not transformed into flesh and blood. However, the body and blood of Christ are spiritually eaten by the believer as nourishment for the soul.

The spiritual eating happens thus: when the believer partakes of the Lord's Supper in the community, he looks upon the bread and the wine offered to him by the Lord. He regards them as no different than if he were receiving the sacrament from the Lord's hand Himself. But he does not dwell solely on the external elements. He considers that it is a sacrament and a sign of higher things. What are those things? The Lord says: "Take, eat; this is my body" [Matthew 26:26 and parallels]. 

Thus, the believer reflects: just as the bread nourishes the body, so the body and blood of Christ sustain the soul of the believer and indeed the whole person. How then can I eat the body of Christ? Not with the mouth and teeth but with faith. And how with faith? When I wholeheartedly believe that He gave His body and blood for us unto death.

Just as eating incorporates food into the body, enabling it to work within the body, so faith brings the power of Christ's suffering to us and makes it fruitful. Thus, the Supper is a spiritual meal, also a memorial of Christ's suffering and a sign of divine goodness toward us, and a bond uniting us all as one body under the headship of Christ [cf. Ephesians 1:22ff].

All this is worked inwardly in man by faith and the grace of God, not by the external sign. Though one should not view the external sign in the sacraments alone, but consider both the sign and what is signified. Yet they do not always occur together; sometimes the sign is received without the thing signified, as Judas received the bread but not the body of Christ [cf. Luke 22:21ff]. On the other hand, Peter, being faithful, received the bread and the body of Christ truly, being truly nourished by the Lord as he recognized in Him the true Savior [cf. Matthew 16:16; John 6:68ff].

Yet even so, the Lord sat bodily at the table and was not physically eaten. Therefore, the eating happens spiritually.

This much I wanted to open up and clarify to you so that you may clearly understand my opinion on the Lord's Supper. This is so, should anyone spread rumors that I have changed my stance or started speaking differently, you may know that these are mere words and not the truth. 

I can well allow that, since it has been clearly confessed, Christ's body is seated at the right hand of God and is no longer physically in this world, and that His body and blood are spiritually eaten by faith, one may use expressions like: "The Lord does not abandon His church" [cf. Psalm 94:14], "The Lord Himself is in the congregation of the saints" [cf. Matthew 18:20]. In the Supper, one truly eats and drinks the body and blood of Christ. The bread of the Lord is His body, and the drink is His blood. However, this should always be explained in light of earlier articles to ensure that people do not fall back into the old view that the body and blood are physically present in the bread and wine. 

For I greatly dislike obscure expressions and would much rather have the people be told clearly what the matter is.

With this, I request that you kindly share this writing of mine concerning the Lord's Supper with other dear gentlemen and brethren. I ask this for God's sake and out of brotherly love and old friendship. Especially, I ask that you show it to my lord Schultheiss von Wattenwyl, my lord Wagner, Tremp, Fischer, and Sulpitius Hauer, my especially dear friends.

For I hear rumors that among many of you, there is a suspicion that I am of a different opinion now than I was before, or that I hold that the matter of the Lord's Supper has not been sufficiently dealt with in your disputation and by my dearly beloved Lord and Master H[uldrych] Zwingli, whose opinion I do not share. Rather, I hold that the matter of Christ's Supper has been faithfully, truly, and sufficiently presented in the churches of the Swiss Confederation thus far.

If Martin Luther should demonstrate otherwise (which I do not believe), we must listen and examine. God will always uphold simplicity and truth.

To the honorable, upright, and wise Petermann in Hag, and the council of Bern, his dear lord and brother.

H. Bullinger.
