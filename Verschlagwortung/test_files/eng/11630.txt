**Strasbourg, November 23, 1541**

May the consolation of the Holy Spirit accompany your wisdom, which at times is intertwined with great sorrow.

I received your most welcome letter on the 20th of November, most learned sir. That you love me sincerely as a brother (something I had already gathered often from your writings) fills me with immense gratitude.

Regarding the cloths sent to Falckner, I now regret that matter, as he is deeply distressed by receiving so much cloth from me. As for the unshorn black cloth he complains about, I would not have sent it to him (as I believe you must have understood well enough from my earlier letters), except that his letter only reached me late while I was in Frankfurt. 

Nevertheless, I cannot sell him that cloth for 18 florins, as it cost me over 20 florins in England. However, since it is now with him (especially as it has such thick threads and coarse wool), if he wishes to keep it for 20 florins, I will be satisfied. If he is unwilling to accept this, please take back the cloth from him, I beg you, and keep it with you until I write to you again, either before or during the next market fair. I may perhaps decide to assign it to another purpose if Falckner refuses it.

I valued the shorn cloth at no more than 28 florins. I sold a similar cloth at the same price to Falckner at the last fair in Strasbourg. However, concerning that cloth (as it seems to your merchants to be so expensive), I do not know what else to write except to advise Mr. Falckner to return it to me during Lent via a coachman known to him who travels through this city to Frankfurt. I do not doubt that I can sell it here for the same price or perhaps more.

If Falckner returns this cloth, I would be greatly obliged if he could also send three bundles of the excellent paper made by Mr. Froschover. (Each bundle contains 20 booklets and is called *ein Riecks* in German.) I particularly desire this type of paper. This letter is written on a sheet of the very paper I want, but if he has better paper, I would also like one or two more bundles for Miles Coverdale and other Englishmen working here. For this paper, I will compensate Froschover or Mr. Falckner, God willing, at the upcoming fair.

Additionally, I ask Mr. Froschover to lend you 15 florins and 12 batz for me on account of the half-piece of black shorn cloth intended for purposes known to your piety. If Falckner sends it back to me, I will faithfully repay Froschover in Frankfurt.

Regarding the half-pieces of cloth you mentioned, I am pleased with the arrangement: that Falckner should keep them until he can sell them, and at the next fair, pay me for them. If not, he should give them to the person I will later designate in Frankfurt.

The *Axiomata* I sent to you were not intended for you to send me your opinion on them. I had no desire to burden your studies for my sake. However, I am grateful that when I visit, you will not disdain to share your judgment on them.

Please greet Mr. Falckner, my dear brother, on my behalf and thank him greatly for the butter, which will be of great use to my household this winter. I also ask him to remember the paper I mentioned earlier. He has asked me to let him know whether I have received your letters from Gallo von Homberg. If you recall, I informed you in my last letter that I had indeed received them.

I intend to send a quarter of fenugreek with this messenger, provided he agrees to carry it. My wife sends her regards to yours; please greet her on my behalf as well.

May God Almighty protect you from harmful pestilence and shield you under His wing, so that through you His kingdom may continue to expand on earth, and your reward in heaven may be all the greater. Amen.

Yours in the Lord,  
**R. Hilles**

I have sent the fenugreek to Basel for John Bourcher, an Englishman staying at the house of Mr. Myconius or Isengrinius.
