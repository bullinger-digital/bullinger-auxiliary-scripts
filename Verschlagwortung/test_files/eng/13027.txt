S

The long-expected messenger finally arrived on the 2nd of August, bringing an unexpected response from the Zurich Senate. I wonder greatly what they think of me or how they intend to deal with me.  

I was the first to arrive; now I am the last remaining in Augsburg, continually striving to conform to their wishes, but receiving no other reward than the realization that they care little for my well-being!  

You have done your duty, for which I thank you most sincerely. Romanus, as I understand, has explained the state and condition of my affairs. I have written letters myself, and as I hear, so have my father-in-law and other relatives, yet none of us have been able to achieve anything.

Well, if it is the Lord’s will (as you write) that, despite all of us pleading against it, I should here confess Christ with my mouth and testify with my blood, may the Lord's will be done. To Him I dedicate and consecrate myself, seeing that I am utterly abandoned by all human help.

I wrote once before, and I write again now, sincerely and from my heart, that I wish—indeed, I desire—to deliver my church with my own blood and life from this tyranny, under which I see all the old errors being cumulatively reintroduced, the malignant spirit returning with seven more wicked spirits, and the final state being worse than the first.  

But since I see that I can neither help the church in this way nor the church help me—and, in fact, the sincerest members of the church advise me to withdraw for a time and wonder why I have not done so, given the many opportunities I have—this has led me to consider my own safety and to not recklessly forgo the means and opportunities the Lord has granted me.

Among those means was the protection of the Zurich Senate, to which I wished to flee. But now, even this is denied me, and I find myself caught entirely between the altar and the stone.  

I know that there is not one among all the brothers who, had they known where they might take refuge as I do, would not have left long ago. Yet I have endured, bearing all things and even this most bitter trial, that I have been forced to hear from certain brothers that I was betrayed by my own Zurich magistracy, and that the magistrates are colluding among themselves in our affairs like Pilate and Herod in the case of Christ.

Though these accusations once caused me excessive bitterness, as no doubt your piety sensed in some of my letters, and though I resolved never to seek their recall again, I have since digested this resentment and set it aside. Forgetting my previous resolve, I fled once more to those who had previously rejected me—whom others interpreted as having betrayed me—now that this new imperial Diet and the Emperor’s arrival has brought fresh tragedy.  

But even now, I have received no better response than before! This not only inflames me further because of my own thoughts but even more because of what others think and reproach me for.

Yet since I know, through your testimony, that their decision was not made with ill will, I suppress my sorrows and, as is right, defend them from such accusations. They imagine (I am sure) something grand for themselves; but if they knew the true reality of my situation, perhaps they would advise me differently.

It is impossible for anyone to comprehend what Augsburg is like or what kind of "swamp of evils" it has become unless they have lived here for some time and observed it closely.  

I remain silent about the current situation, where all the filth of wickedness from every nation flows together into this one suitable cesspool. Here the most depraved Spaniards hold absolute power.  

Even if I wrote for an entire day, I could not sufficiently describe the violence they commit and the injuries they inflict upon our wretched citizens: they throw them out of their homes, drag them from their beds, and steal and plunder whatever they can. Rarely does a day pass without the discovery of some murdered bodies.  

Assassins are abundant, hired for the smallest sum to kill anyone. The Emperor is ignorant of this. Our magistracy is weaker than a fly!  

I have written certain things in previous letters, which I send along with this one. I did not want to change them, for they are quite detailed, and the common Swiss messenger still lingers here. From these, you can infer other things.

Beyond all other promises, we are now expelled from our churches, forced to give place to Satan and yield to superstition. Who could endure all this, even if they completely disregarded the safety of their body but still cared for the peace of their conscience?

I remember what Ambrose once did. If anyone today tried to imitate him, or Christ driving out the ecclesiastical merchants, they would achieve nothing but the abolition of all—even private—preaching.  

For this reason (although all things are lawful, not all things are edifying), we cannot openly resist this impiety by force. In the meantime, however, we admonish our people in our sermons not to participate in these acts of impiety.

On August 1, the Marian cathedral, where Musculus formerly presided, began to be decorated—or rather, defiled—with idols. This was done by our own magistrates, who preserved them (despite our public and private warnings to burn them secretly).  

In the Dominican church, masses and funeral rites for the queen are performed daily. That wicked crowd of Baal worshipers cries out all day, trying to recall her soul from hell.  

Such things happen constantly. I cannot list them all, and even if I could, I would not have time to write them. Twelve bishops follow the Emperor everywhere, partly Italians, partly Spaniards, each accompanied by their retinue of priests, so the city is full of this rabble.

We are the scum of the world, like sheep destined for slaughter. Whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord; it is our duty to fill up in our bodies the afflictions of Christ.  

I do not shrink from dying for Him, who is my life, but these men do not deal with us openly. They infiltrate deceitfully until they regain full control.

I would prefer to return to open conflict with them in the future than to see them now reintroducing their errors! But let the Lord’s will be done.  

What our Senate will write in reply to the Zurich Senate, I do not know. They promise much but deliver nothing! But what could they provide, since they are powerless?

They are so powerless that they could not even protect Lepusculus, who was forced to leave his house and leave behind his wine and wood for the Spaniards!  

Had I relied on their help rather than always on the Lord’s, I would have left long ago and, above all, would not remain here for even an hour now.  

Welser promised that they would release me within four or five weeks, for he (as the more honest one) admits that they cannot provide me with any protection or defense.  

But I do not know if this will happen or if others even granted him the authority to make such a promise to me. I will endure as long as I can, knowing that if I receive no reward from Zurich, I will still receive a great reward from the Lord.  

Farewell. Greet all the brothers, especially my dear Gwalther, to whom I write less often because I know that you share everything; otherwise, he would always have his own letters appended to yours.

He himself endured no small danger. Thanks be to God that this storm has subsided. Would that my affairs could find so peaceful a resolution!  

As I write this, Musculus arrives with some news. Yesterday, around 6 in the evening, the son of Mayor Herbrot and a clerk of his, called Feuchtweck, along with a Saxon secretary still loyal to the elector, were in the mayor's garden outside the gate. As they returned home, three horsemen with spears attacked them, shouting, "Those are the right ones!" and charging at them.  

The Saxon secretary was stabbed and barely brought back to the gate alive before he died. Feuchtweck suffered two mortal wounds. Musculus does not know what became of the mayor’s son. I will investigate and let you know.

Nothing happened to him because he fled in time.  

Such things happen all the time. Many honorable people are leaving so that they might protect their children from dishonor. Boys are even less safe than women. May God have mercy on us!

Xystus was approached over twenty times about taking boys from the school, as it became apparent for what purpose they were needed.  

I will wait out this month. If they believe me, good; if not, I will call on God for help and free myself from this situation. No reasonable person will blame me for this.

Farewell again.  
August 4.  
You know my hand.

I beg you to share this letter with all the gentlemen, brothers, and the Lord of Kyburg, for I do not have the time to write to everyone individually.  

I send you a lampoon against us from the imperial court, a history of the capture of the Elector, and the terms of the Landgrave's surrender. He is still held in custody at Werda.

To the most distinguished master Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful overseer of the Zurich church, singularly esteemed lord.  

From your servant, Heinrich.
