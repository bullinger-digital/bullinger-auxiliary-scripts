This good man expresses the greatest possible thanks to you for your support, through which his son was admitted to the college of scholars, and he wishes to demonstrate his gratitude to you in every possible way.

Through Christ, he also earnestly asks me to commend him to you once again, as if from the beginning, so that, with your intercession, he may be able to obtain from that Otto Werdmuller, to whom he owes 10 florins on behalf of his son, that Otto kindly accept 5 florins (which he has borrowed) now, with the assurance that the remaining five will be received after the autumn.

Since he is truly a good man, I earnestly implore you to assist him in this matter as well, in accordance with your kindness. His fortune is exceedingly meager, and Otto would be greatly earning Christâ€™s favor if he were to grant such a small delay to this unfortunate man.
