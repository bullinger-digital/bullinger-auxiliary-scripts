I ask your pardon, and that of all there, especially yours, most holy man, for not having written to any of you for so long.
Indeed, nothing has diminished in my respect for you and your church, and in all things, we feel the same in the Lord and draw great consolation from our mutual agreement with you.
However, the reasons for my long silence have been certain grave disturbances and cares of mine, which the Lord, according to His divine will, has sent me and, to His glory, has exercised me. Additionally, there have been certain troubles that Satan has stirred up against me and our churches here and continues to do so without ceasing.

As for my personal disturbances, I know it is no secret to you that nearly a year ago the Lord took from me my former partner in life, my wife, whose memory will never fade from my mind. This is not only because of her piety and virtue but also because of the children she bore, who are constantly before my eyes.
How grievous this wound has been to me, humanly speaking, and still is, you can easily imagine. I say nothing of the domestic affairs, all of which were entrusted to her and have now fallen entirely to me—something for which I was unaccustomed and by my very nature unsuited.

As for my health, I say nothing either, as it is so worn down that, even when I seem to be at my best, I am never truly well. I can dedicate only the early hours of the morning to serious matters without discomfort from my condition.
This was also the reason why, seeing that I was incapable of managing my domestic affairs, I turned my mind to a second marriage. I could not otherwise bear the burden of both household concerns and my ministry, given my health, which I still struggle to manage amidst the ever-arising troubles that must constantly be fought.

Yet, just as the Lord tested me with the death of my first wife, so He has alleviated my sorrow with His kindness by giving me another wife. He has again provided me with a pious and faithful life partner, in whom I lack nothing in terms of duty and who allows me to devote myself more fully to my ministry by God's grace—so long as my health does not hinder me.

As for the troubles here, it would take too long to recount everything. Satan spares no effort in opposing us because of the reestablishment of discipline in our churches. He feels his hypocrisy losing its place among us, as the observance of discipline inevitably exposes and undermines such false piety, making it impossible for it to endure. Hypocrites wish to appear holy and prefer praise to correction.

Since the practice of discipline involves nothing but admonitions that challenge their simulated holiness and accuse the corruption of our nature, hypocrites find such discipline unbearable. They stir up chaos everywhere in an attempt to make discipline despised and protect their hypocrisy from it. Satan spares no effort, using all his cunning to hinder the practice of discipline.

The craftiness of our hypocrites here is remarkable. They do not want to appear to oppose discipline but, being ashamed of themselves under its scrutiny, cry out that they are treated more harshly than others. They seek to implicate as many as possible by fabricating accusations against them. If we do not comply with their demands, they loudly denounce us as partial judges, even though they cannot substantiate their accusations.

One particular troublemaker, removed from public ministry for some disgraceful offense by order of the magistrate, cannot rest until he finds someone to share in his shame. Because he cannot find anything to reproach in the life or conduct of any minister in either of our churches (thanks be to God!), he seeks opportunities to sow discord in doctrine. He even exaggerates the controversy over predestination and accuses us everywhere of condemning Calvin's name and doctrine.

However, as no one, including himself, has ever heard me speak against Calvin—whom I revere and love as a man of God—he has directed his efforts at one of our colleagues. He has begun accusing this colleague in many ways, hoping to bring him to the same disgrace as himself.

The accusations are as follows:

That our colleague said Adam's sin was not sufficient to condemn the human race.
That someone could be saved without any knowledge of Christ.
That he taught something different from Calvin on predestination and spoke ill of Calvin's name.
These accusations, however, lack any evidence, and the accuser demands that we compel our colleague to publicly confess guilt and resign from his ministry. I cannot agree, as the first two accusations are outright denied by our colleague and lack proof. The third is admitted in part, as he acknowledges disagreeing with Calvin, but he denies ever disparaging Calvin's name or writings.

Here you have an example of one controversy briefly outlined. We have yet to see its end. But another, much graver matter concerns a minister of the Word in our German church—though not Martin Micronius—who caused a great disturbance with three points, without consulting any of us, likely fearing our disapproval:

He taught that baptismal sponsors (commonly called godparents) should not be admitted.
He publicly condemned as idolatry and a violation of the Lord's institution all churches that do not use public assemblies for the Lord's Supper.
He declared that those who allow kneeling during Communion are ministers of Antichrist.
After being admonished by us and the elders of both churches, he eventually confessed his error before the elders, admitting not only the novelty of his doctrines but also that he harbored unwarranted suspicions of us. Yet he now regrets this confession, claiming he was persuaded by human reasoning rather than divine authority.

Despite this, he had signed his name to our doctrine and given thanks to God for revealing his error. But now he discredits all this, claiming the Holy Spirit now leads him to reject it and accuses us of teaching these things for human approval.

Brother, this is another of our troubles. It nearly brought both our churches to ruin if God had not miraculously intervened. We are not yet out of danger, but we trust the Lord, before whom we act in good conscience. We await the minister's final response in five days. May God grant a good outcome to this matter!

Amid these troubles, new ones continually arise, which overwhelm me, though not so greatly as to prevent me from mentioning court affairs. I cannot free myself entirely from them.

Why this complaint, you ask? First, to request your prayers for us and our churches. Second, so you understand why I cannot always write when I wish.

I now have before me the ceremonies of our church and its governance, which I hope to publish by winter. I write this with our Theseus, Martin Micronius, whom we greatly rejoice to have in our church here.

The King of Poland is said to be preparing a new marriage, and many think he plans to restore religion among his people and might even summon me. But I cannot promise anything certain about my affairs yet.

Our King of England, long ill, has now recovered (thanks be to our Lord God). I would gladly know what you wrote to Hooper about predestination, as I have not been able to see it due to his absence, though he promised several times to forward your letters to me.

Farewell, most upright man. Please commend me to all your colleagues, especially Pellican, Bibliander, Gwalther, and Gesner.

Hastily, from London, June 7, 1553.
I did not have time to proofread, so please excuse any errors.

Yours truly and wholeheartedly,
John à Lasco, by my own hand.

Please also commend us to Calvin and explain to him our troubles here. Ask him, in my name, not to believe any rumors about us without first hearing the full account from me.

To the most holy and learned man, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Church of Zurich, my most esteemed brother in the Lord.
