S. P.

Even though I have no news, I still do not want your envoy, an excellent and virtuous man dear to all, to leave without my response. He will tell you that all is well here and also among us, thanks be to the gods.

I only fear one thing: what this beast means by the marriage of Spain and England. But the subjects and nobles of the kingdom of England declare they would rather choose death, so it is hoped that a great upheaval will occur unless the plan is changed.

As for the Emperor and Ferdinand, I have heard for certain, as I suspected, that there is collusion between them, and I fear that our Vergerius may stumble in this matter.

On Saturday, I will be in Solothurn; after that, if I have any news, expect it from me.

The Pope was sick unto death and is still ill, but there is hope for his recovery.

Farewell and be well, excellent man.

From Freiburg, December 20th.  
Yours always,  
Bassafontaneus
