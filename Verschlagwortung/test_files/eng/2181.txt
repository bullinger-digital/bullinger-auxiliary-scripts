Gaspar, the noble Pomeranian who recently returned from Italy and to whom you said you could show Servetus' writings, brought me the saddest news that my dearest mother has passed away. This has greatly unsettled my plans, although I do not despair nor lose heart. Instead, humbled under the mighty hand of God, I wait to see what He also has determined for me.

However, you will not cease in your prayers, that He may be present with me and deliver me from all evil. I also beg you to send letters to Vergerius.

I will devour your books on the grace of God as soon as I can see and obtain them.

I stayed here longer than I had expected, but tomorrow, God willing, I will depart and write to you more extensively from Geneva. In the meantime, fare well, and remember your Laelius with some kindness.

Greet all our friends.

Basel, February 5, 1554.

Your most devoted,
Laelius Socinus
