Willing service and all good things, etc.  

Friendly and dearly beloved brother-in-law,  

After your departure, as you have seen on the given date, Hans Jacob of Brugg sent a boy to me with the enclosed letter. Inside was the prince’s letter and two reports from his servants, with which they informed the prince about what Hans Jacob had achieved in Augsburg concerning his affairs, etc.  

I have quickly copied them, solely for your service, so that nothing is hidden from you and that you may thoroughly understand all matters as they stand. I am therefore sending them to you herewith. However, you should return everything to me, enclosed in your letter, via this messenger when he comes back from Rychenwyler.  

I have answered him in writing and know well that he will not be pleased. But I have done what I am obligated to before God, and it would be good for him if he followed my advice. However, he follows no one but himself.  

He intends to return soon and settle back home. I consider that impossible and have also written to him accordingly. He will now see in reality what I have always told him about the future—namely, that the king will leave those in government as they are and will again guide matters in their favor. This has now happened.  

Even if they were to grant him passage at this moment, what does he intend to accomplish? Even if he were a governor a hundred times over, which he is not, he would still not be able to carry out the matter. He no longer possesses his royal privileges and now intends to act against the law. How? For what reason? Or does he think he can establish something now?  

The king has dismissed him so smoothly to the clover meadow, and I fear that he will not be able to hold on to the prince. He has squandered and wasted the money that he was supposed to spend on gunpowder and has not achieved anything. He has kept the prince waiting for a long time and made false promises; when the prince realizes this, he will trust no one anymore, etc.  

Therefore, my advice is that you no longer burden yourself with him in the future, as you have done so far, for he can neither be advised nor helped.  

My wife sends you and your children her friendly greetings, as do I.  

God be with you.
