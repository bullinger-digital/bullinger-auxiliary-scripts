To the Reverend Father, Greetings

Recently, I wrote to you, most esteemed man, while wearing a hat and boots, urging you in all seriousness and with great haste, as I recall, to send your son to us whenever you wish and to command that he should stay with us entirely. I entrusted this letter, as well as others that I notice you have not yet received, to someone from Constance who promised me his sincere efforts and utmost reliability.

Three months have passed, most honored Mr. Bullinger, since I sought your pious counsel on what I should do. Having dwelled so long among the profane, immersed in the detestable worship of abomination, I hastened my journey back to my homeland for the sole purpose of pursuing purer doctrine. Yet here I have discovered a cunning blindness and a defection of our learned teachers to Lutheranism (pardon the term).

I confess that I am a citizen born of this city, whose church, at the time of my birth into this valley of misery, was free of all crude and vain disputes, as you yourself knew well some years ago. Thus, long ago, in my eighteenth year—three years ago this Epiphany by God's grace—I became a member of our church's common confession, which was at that time still untainted.

Now, returning to once again share in that same consolation, I find myself at a loss as to where I should turn. Heretics are so frivolously condemned here that, if we were not distracted by external conflicts and wars, we would undoubtedly turn the sword and blade upon ourselves in what is claimed to be true zeal.

I am now about to set out for Italy, trusting in divine mercy. Yet even then, I would greatly prefer to remain here for a longer time. However, I cannot come to you, no matter how eagerly I wish to, nor can I endure what my steadfastness cannot bear or what would violate my conscience. I even fear that it may be truly wicked to enjoy gratuitous benefits.

Therefore, I implore your guidance: please do not hesitate to explain what you wish me to do. I remind you of this again because I suspect my previous letters have been lost.

Behold, these Jesuit deceivers' works—unworthy of your eyes—but in refuting which one of your disciples may find it worthwhile to make an effort. These true hypocrites gain enormous honors among the ignorant masses with their feigned learning.

If the matter concerned law or even trivial disputes, as is my profession, I would gladly engage myself in it. For I have long read among reputable jurists that Jesuits are not religious in the true sense—that is, not genuine monks—and that they cannot lawfully enjoy ecclesiastical revenues, even if the Pope himself were to dispense them.

As for Guillaume Postel, the founder of this order, you know some of his Greek doctrines, though he is otherwise a learned man. There is also a book among us about their origins, which I have sent to some of my acquaintances but can no longer procure. However, I have taken care that you receive a copy.

I have sent it to Mr. Beza, an exceptional man whom I venerate, love, and honor, along with all the godly. To their confession in the Christian religion, I subscribe as a client for all my life.

But look, suddenly the boy asks for an example. I beg you to give even a slight reading to this trifling and then offer it to your disciples to mock.

Please deliver the enclosed letters...which.

News from the assemblies has come that the king, contrary to the custom of the empire, has appointed select individuals to oversee matters of religious differences. Our party finds it impossible to accept this, as these individuals have been chosen from the very dregs of our opponents. He made the prince of Bavaria their president—a man whom, if you do not yet know, imagine at least as a drunken beast who cares neither for God nor anyone else.

A man in his court, known to you, is honest and truly candid. Without him, I fear that greater tyranny would be exercised by the beast and the gluttons than by the kings of France or Spain. However, I must confess that I would live more freely under either of them than under this one, who is joined by others of his ilk—like Mr. Jonas, Mr. Lucretius of Brunswick, the archbishop of Salzburg, and others of the same kind.

Protestants have once again openly declared before the king their unanimous profession that they will not concede even a single point until it is allowed to all throughout the empire to embrace their faith without loss of property or titles. If they have never demanded this too carefully or ardently, they certainly do so now with some degree of insolence.

The Lord has hardened Pharaoh's heart so that he would sooner leave his kingdom with only a single staff than honor his private obligations.

What is happening? The Turk, with his immense forces, will devour us by land and sea. The Venetians report that he has invaded our borders with greater numbers than ever.

The margrave is dead, leaving behind greater disputes over the principality than he resolved in life. Believe me, many crimes are falsely attributed to him, of which he was never conscious.

Farewell, most esteemed father.
