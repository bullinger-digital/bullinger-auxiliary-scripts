To the most esteemed man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, a brother and most honorable colleague.

Greetings.

Since the brevity of time does not permit me to respond to your letter at length, I wish to testify to you only this: I have scarcely ever received letters from you more gratifying, and they have greatly helped to lighten my domestic sorrow, which had deeply troubled me following the recent death of my wife.

I greatly rejoice that there is now hardly anything� or almost nothing� that remains to bring us into full agreement even in words. Certainly, if you deem it expedient, I would not hesitate to make the effort to come there in person so that you might better ascertain all the thoughts of my heart. Never shall I be the obstacle to our establishing solid peace, so that we may all confess Christ with one voice.[AS1]

But now another reason compels me to write. You mention, in part, what prevents you from entering into the French alliance. I acknowledge that pious people are rightly terrified by the example of Jehoshaphat, who, by forming an unfortunate alliance with a wicked king, brought ruin upon himself and his kingdom. Yet I interpret that he did not suffer punishment merely for making a covenant with the king of Israel but rather for taking up an evil and unjust cause to cater to the king's ambitions. Jehoshaphat was driven by ambition to provoke the Syrians unnecessarily. He complied with this and recklessly took up arms. Furthermore, they stubbornly proceeded, despite the Lord clearly forbidding it through Micaiah.

This example, therefore, does not lead me to conclude that every alliance with impious people is illicit. For I see that Abraham was not hindered by any religious scruple from making a covenant with Abimelech. I also see Isaac, David, and others doing the same without incurring either rebuke or punishment. Thus, I conclude that such alliances should not be sought eagerly, as they always involve great danger. Nevertheless, if just and compelling reasons press upon us, I see no reason to utterly reject them.

As for this alliance under discussion, I fear it ought to be avoided unless the current state of affairs forces us to take a contrary position. Your business is with a declared enemy of Christ, one who rages daily against our brothers. He scarcely deserves our trust, as he wishes for nothing more than for us to perish along with Christ. It is absurd to establish friendship with someone who wages war against all servants of Christ and who allies himself with a force stained by innocent blood.

Indeed, I would wish nothing to be concluded unless it expressly and explicitly guarantees the safety of pious brothers. For his officers are now marauding everywhere with astounding cruelty. Added to this is the suspicion of an English war. I do not think it right to offer any assistance to attack a kingdom where Christ is worshipped. Moreover, the injustice of the cause itself is another obstacle.

Yet, when I consider how afflicted our circumstances are, how great the calamities are that still threaten, almost to the destruction of the church, I greatly fear that, if we neglect the resources that are now permissible, it may be attributed more to excessive complacency than to pious trust. I am not unaware that God is most present and helps most powerfully when we are entirely destitute of human resources. I also know how difficult it is not to turn one's eyes toward any shadow of Egypt that presents itself. Unless fixed solely on God, such wandering glances bring ruin and destruction.

Thus, these dangers must be carefully anticipated. Nevertheless, care must also be taken that, in our current extreme difficulties, we do not reject aid that could have supported us without offense to God, only to later regret our excessive caution to our own detriment. My first concern is that, if Pharaoh is excluded from any hope of forming an alliance with you, he may turn to Antiochus. Though they have strong reasons for discord, the latter is a cunning master of pretexts. And those who rule in our court today will desire nothing more than to bend the mind of this inexperienced and imprudent youth toward accepting any terms of peace. Certainly, unless he achieves something, he will soon throw himself away, and there will be no shortage of those willing to push him to do so. 

And may it not be that among us there are those who would sell both themselves and us to Antiochus, should the opportunity arise. Whatever Pharaoh attempts, he will act not only with Antiochus applauding but also assisting, believing this is how he can avenge his rejection. Meanwhile, cruelty will ignite everywhere in his kingdom. Like women, he will redirect his rage elsewhere. This matter, too, must not be overlooked.[AS2]

If I were concerned only with my private life or interests, I would immediately relocate elsewhere. But when I reflect on how much influence this corner of the world has on advancing Christ�s kingdom, I am rightly anxious about its preservation. And here, your well-being and some measure of peace also depend in part. What course will not desperation drive a man steeped in wicked counsels to pursue, once alienated from you?

Do you think we lack individuals—some restless and eager for change, others greedy—who will reach out to Pharaoh? Above all, whenever I think of the wretched brothers oppressed under that dreadful tyranny, my heart softens, and I am more inclined toward what would better assist them. It is clear how the tyrant’s rage will erupt when he sees himself despised and rejected, and how much greater freedom the wicked will have to oppress the innocent.[AS3]

However, if some alliance were formed, Pharaoh would temporarily be restrained, and the executioners would dare less. Furthermore, a path would open in the future to extinguish the flames. Therefore, my dear Bullinger, I beg and implore you to weigh all these matters while there is time. If your people should decide to enter into any agreement, strive and ensure that they remember their brothers, who are in such wretched and harsh circumstances. Although I know that their welfare is already well-entrusted to you and that you are willing to care for it wherever the opportunity arises, I did not wish to neglect my duty.

His ferocity is such that he will not tolerate any strict condition being imposed on him. Yet, I hope it may be possible to secure some degree of moderation. Farewell, most distinguished man and brother in the Lord, held in highest esteem.

Give my warmest regards to Lords Theodore, Pellicanus, Gualter, Werdm�ller, and the other colleagues. My fellow colleagues also send their greetings, including Gallasius among others.

I pray to the Lord Jesus that He may continue to guide you with His Spirit, be with you, and bless your labors.

I am deeply grateful for the volume of sermons sent in your name by Haller.

On the Nones of May, 1549.
