To the very distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, faithful and most learned minister of the Church of Zurich, our most revered father in Christ.

Greetings.

While your diligence, most excellent man, in writing to us is greatly appreciated, it is indeed from those most gracious letters that your incredible love for us, your singular care for our church, and your most fervent devotion to unity are manifest.

We sent a number of questions to your piety, in which the essence and, as it were, the pivot of the entire controversy seemed to be situated. These were accurately answered by your piety; however, with your good permission, we must say that we are not satisfied.

First, your piety responds that it is possible for rules regarding clerical vestments to be prescribed for ministers, so that by their color and form they are distinguished from the laity; for this, you state, is a civil observation, and that the apostle desires a bishop to be κοσμιον (orderly).

Since this question was proposed concerning ecclesiastical men and pertains to ecclesiastical polity, we do not see how the distinct and clerical dress of ministers can pertain to a civil matter. While we acknowledge that a bishop ought to be κοσμιον, we refer this, with Ambrose, to the adornment of the mind, not to the clothing of the body. And though we require honesty, dignity, and gravity in attire, we deny that decorum should be sought from the enemies of our religion.

Second, you respond hypothetically: if a hat and garment, not unsuitable for a minister and free from superstition, are commanded for use by ministers, Judaism is therefore not truly revived. But how can a garment that served the theater and pomp of the papal priesthood be suitable for the simple ministry of Christ? For, as our people have persuaded your piety, it is not only the square cap and foreign dress that are required, but also sacred vestments are used in the temple: the surplice, or white choir robe, and the cope are reinstated. These, not only papists themselves in their books, but even your piety, as you have often demonstrated from Innocentius, admit to being certain imitations and representations of Judaism.

We readily subscribe to the testimony of D. Martyr, our most esteemed teacher. But the examples he cites pertain to decorum and order; these [Roman vestments] deform the church, disrupt εθταχιαν (order), and overturn all sense of propriety. The former align with the light of nature; the latter are grotesque and monstrous. The former, according to Tertullian's rule, had pure necessity and utility; the latter are utterly foolish, superfluous, and useless, serving neither edification nor any good purpose. Rather, as our Martyr puts it, they splendidly serve the cult that today all pious people execrate.

The distinction of ecclesiastical vestments adopted today is acknowledged even by the papists as a papal invention. The constitutions of Otto speak of it, the Pontifical book reveals it, and the eyes and mouths of all confirm it. The use of churches, stipends, baptism, the creed, and the like originated before the birth of the papacy by divine institution. And with Augustine, whatever divine and legitimate thing we find in a heresy, we approve, retain, and do not reject. But since this [Roman vestments] belongs specifically to that error and dissension, we, with Augustine, rightly condemn and correct it.

As for your addition that vestments were not abolished at the beginning of the Reformation, our people have again misrepresented the truth. For in many places, during the reign of the most serene King Edward VI, the Lord's Supper was celebrated purely without the surplice, and the cope, which was then abolished by law, has now been publicly reinstated. This is not to uproot papism but to plant it anew, not to progress in piety but to regress.

You say the priestly attire is civil; you deny that it smacks of monasticism, papism, or Judaism. Yet we do not doubt that your prudence understands, from their books, what the papists prattle about the surplice, how highly they regard the clerical habit, and how it is dedicated to religion.

Moreover, that ambitious and Pharisaic prescription of peculiar dress, to which they today attribute no less significance than monks once did to their cowls, indeed reeks of monasticism and papism. The belief in sanctity and merit did not suddenly arise but crept in gradually and imperceptibly. Because we fear this may happen here as well, we do not act rashly but attempt to oppose such beginnings.

We do not side with Eustathius, who placed religion in clothing, but oppose those who superstitiously require distinctive religious garments as symbols of their priesthood. The same must be said about the canon of the Council of Gangra, Laodicea, and the Sixth Synod.

We judge that departing from the liberty in which we have thus far stood is a kind of servitude. Here, we have not quarreled, we have not contended hatefully, we have always avoided bitter disputes, and we seek friendly consultations. We do not yield to wolves but are forced and driven from our place unwillingly and with lamentation.

We permit brothers and bishops to stand or fall before their Lord; we submissively, though unsuccessfully, seek the same equity for ourselves. In rites, nothing is free. Nor is it by our instigation that royal majesty is provoked, but by the persuasion of others, so that now, finally, not what is expedient for the church, but what is merely permissible, is established. What is not entirely impious is deemed healthy and sacred and binding.

Ceremonies and priestly vestments, being symbols of religion and marks of profession, are not civil. Sought mutually from enemies, they are not regarded as decent, and being marked by divine anathema, detested by all the pious, admired by the wicked and weak, and believed indispensable for ministers and sacraments, they cannot and should not be counted among indifferent things.

The ancient fathers had their garments, but not all bishops had their own, nor were they distinct from the laity. The examples of D. John and Cyprian are singular. Sisinius was a heretic and is not presented as praiseworthy or imitable for us. The pallium was common to all Christians, as Tertullian reports in that book, and as your piety has noted elsewhere. 
Chrysostom mentions the white garment, but only incidentally; he neither commends nor praises it but reproaches it. Whether it belonged to the priests or to other Greeks, whether it was made of linen or wool, whether it was white or clean, has not yet been established. Certainly, it is opposed by him and Jerome to the filthy garment of the people of Antioch, and Blondo mentions the woolen pallium. Thus, no certain conclusion can be drawn from this ambiguity.

The prescription of vestments does not align with Christian liberty, as Bucer testifies. He judged the distinction of vestments to be entirely abolished in the Anglican churches due to their current misuse, the need for a clearer declaration of detestation for Antichrist, the fuller profession of Christian liberty, and the elimination of dissension among brothers. Bucer expressed these views in his letter to a Lasco, who was entirely ours.

Hence, it is evident that grave scandal arises and edification is hindered. Concessions should indeed be made to the times, but only temporarily—such that we always progress and never regress. May it never be that we sow schisms in the church through contentious disputes or antagonize our brothers by hostile opposition, stirring the pot unnecessarily.

May it also never be, excellent Bullinger, that we condemn things indifferent by nature as impious. May it never be that, under the guise of offense, we conceal our affections or make conscience out of *contention for trivialities* (*ξιλονεικια*). This dross and leaven of papism, trust us, is the seedbed of all dissension. We desire this to be removed and buried in eternal oblivion so that no vestiges of Antichristian superstition may remain.

We have always been displeased with the primacy and arrogance of the papacy; will tyranny in a free church be agreeable? Free synods among Christians have thus far resolved the knots of controversies; why now should everything be referred to the judgment of one or another individual? Where this liberty of voices and votes reigns, there truth flourishes and thrives.

In short, reverend father, know this: these matters primarily confirm our faith—the authority of the Scriptures, the simplicity of Christ’s ministry, the purity of the earliest and best churches, which we omit recalling for brevity’s sake.

On the other hand, we have neither encountered nor heard of any law, general decree of the most high God, of any reformed church, or of any universal council (Augustine’s rule) supporting these practices. Furthermore, we have found that the examples cited thus far are particular and do not establish universals.

We conclude, therefore, that not everything permissible should be imposed, but only what edifies the church in every way should be introduced. Nor does what is lawful for one person necessarily apply to all. We have pure and uncorrupted doctrine (praise be to God!); why should we falter in worship, which is no insignificant part of religion? Why do we accept a maimed Christ rather than a whole, pure, and perfect one?

Why do we seek examples of reformation from papist enemies and not from you, our brothers? The confession of our churches is the same; the doctrine and rule of faith are the same. Why, then, is there such dissimilarity and diversity in rites and ceremonies? The sign is the same; why do the signs differ so greatly, appearing dissimilar to yours but similar to the papists’? Christ is the same leader and commander; why are hostile banners raised in our churches, which, if we were men of God and possessed of any zeal, we would have long since detested and demolished?

We have always thought well of the bishops, interpreting their pride charitably. Why, then, can they not bear with us—who once kissed the cross with them, now preach the same Christ, and share the same sweet yoke? Why do they throw us into prisons? Why do they persecute us because of our vestments? Why do they deprive us of sustenance and possessions? Why do they publicly malign us in books? Why do they commend a bad cause to posterity in published writings?

They have also translated some pamphlets of Bucer, Peter Martyr, and now your private letters to us into our language and published them publicly without our consent or knowledge. While advancing their own cause and defending their own honor, they show no regard for our church, their brothers, your dignity, or future generations.

That your paternity may understand this is not a light or trivial matter but one of great weight, know that the dispute is not merely over a cap or surplice but over a most serious matter. We are sending you a few fragments and remnants of papist religion, from which you, in your prudence, may easily infer the rest and devise, in your piety, some remedy as soon as possible.

We pray to our Lord Jesus Christ that He may quiet these tumults and disturbances, assert His glory, and send laborers into His vineyard so that the harvest may be joyful and abundant. We also implore you to act with fatherly counsel, public writing, and private letters to work, labor, and achieve that either these evils may be removed or that good men, not yet persuaded, may be tolerated, so that those whom the firm bond of doctrine has united may not be separated by Roman ceremonies.

Greet Gwalter, Simler, Lavater, and Wolf, our esteemed lords. If you confer with them, it will be most gratifying to us and to the entire church.

May the Lord Jesus bless His shelter and your Zurich!

July, in the year 1566.

These things are written briefly and hastily, not so much to respond as to admonish. What could be said on this subject is infinite. Now you must decide not what is being done or can be done but what ought to be done.

Your paternity’s most devoted servants,

Laurentius Humfredus, Tho. Sampson.

Following this, the text notes additional issues still present in the Anglican Church:

1. Public prayers, while not impure, retain some appearance of papist superstition, not only in matins and evensong but also in the Lord’s Supper.
2. The use of intricate and broken musical tones and organs in churches is growing.
3. In administering baptism, the minister addresses the infant; godparents respond on behalf of the child concerning faith, renouncing the world, the flesh, and the devil, in the absence of the parent. The baptized is signed with the cross.
4. Women are given the power to baptize at home.
5. In the Lord’s Supper, sacred vestments, namely the cope and surplice, are used; kneeling is required for communicants; unleavened wafers are substituted for common bread.
6. Outside the temple, and generally for all ministers, papist vestments are prescribed. Bishops wear a linen garment (called a rochet) and carry square caps, liripipes, and long gowns borrowed from the papists.
7. The nerve of religion, discipline, is nonexistent; the church has no rod, and no form of censure is exercised.
8. Marriage for ministers of the church is not publicly permitted or sanctioned by the laws of the kingdom, and their children are considered illegitimate by some.
9. Solemn betrothal is conducted in the papist manner and rite, using a ring.
10. Women are still purified with a veil.
Here is the full translation of the additional points without omissions:
F11. In ecclesiastical governance, many remnants of the Antichristian church are preserved. Just as in ancient Rome, everything in the papal forum was for sale, so in the metropolitan courts, almost everything is offered for sale: pluralities of benefices, licenses for non-residence, for not initiating sacred rites, for eating meat on prohibited days, and during Lent, a time when even celebrating weddings without a dispensation and payment is considered a sin.
12. The free power of preaching has been taken away from Christ’s ministers. Those who now wish to preach must not advocate for any innovation in the rites; instead, they are compelled to sign with their hands an approval of all the ceremonies.
13. Finally, the article on spiritual communion, which in clear terms opposed and abolished the real presence in the Eucharist and contained a most explicit explanation of the truth, was published during the reign of Edward VI. Now it is being circulated among us mutilated and truncated.
