1554
I received your letter, most esteemed lord and godfather, through Rüenli, the courier of your city, to which I do not have anything particular to respond.
Three days ago, some of our legates returned from Graio.
Steigerus of the people was sent to take care of private matters there; likewise, I learned that he is in his Montaniacus. Of the other two, I have heard nothing so far, nor from others, regarding whether anything has been accomplished there by our people or what is affirmed from Gaul.
They are extremely impatient, and if I understand correctly, they are holding back on their matters, but all will soon be revealed.
In the meantime, we hear that printing has begun.
Tigurum [Zurich] has also been passed without issue, although my information comes from the conversations of others, and I cannot confirm it myself.
There is much work here, almost enough to burden the entire land, as you will more fully understand from these details and from what I am writing.
Audebatius, whom you will now understand from what I am writing to you, has gone to the Count de La Val. Regarding Andelot, the lord, or perhaps the admiral's son, it seems he has already been transferred and relocated. He sends his most amicable regards.
The same Frenchman, due to an inheritance, has become a preacher. He tells me extraordinary things about these French matters and that nothing else can be expected. The confusion of their affairs is tearing the kingdom apart.
The treachery is so great that it seems all has been revealed. The summary of history is that their efforts have almost entirely failed. The summary of the story is that they are entrenched in their positions and unable to proceed further, even as they trusted that everything would be accomplished.
They seized opportunities from the garrison they disturbed, with traitors both foreign and domestic conspiring together. This was carried out by certain individuals (which is most affirmed) who marked times and places to gather themselves and occupy key positions. They aim to dominate the Protestant regions, and some preachers have subsequently crossed over to the Catholic side.
This death, these dangers, and these treacherous plots were especially directed against those of La Rochelle.
Once suppressed, God intervened, and we denounce the traitors for their sloth and negligence—in their own name, no less. We count them as the same kind of traitors: in which place and for what neglect, afterwards, we shall not be able to share their plans.
Moreover, because someone from among them was negligent, all twelve individuals were later confirmed in that faction and are to be apprehended with them. They set out for those camps, carrying out what they had planned, and soon took many others.
They claim in their own words that by deepening the severity of this situation, they also seized a few more and inflicted harm on them. They arrived, took some prisoners subject to capital punishment, and carried them off, especially those from among the citizens who were prepared to inflict greater harm.
Meanwhile, Medinus, aware of the king's knowledge of this treachery, laments the fate of those doomed to die. He adds that Morumnantius departed on those same days, and the traitors still hold that place.
In the meantime, governance in that area seems to remain stable, but we await further news. We expect to hear about decisions and actions soon, and success may depend on whether matters are resolved immediately.
Memmontius has also informed the king of these tragedies. Meanwhile, the French from Castillon have informed the king of this entire tragic matter and the insult suffered, and in 1555 they acted at the proper time, urging him to take action.
In the meantime, we await updates from the neighboring region and the governance there. It seems success may depend on whether matters are resolved immediately.
 
Regarding my health:
I wrote to my brother about it, and it is more or less unchanged. My strength is not entirely broken, but both body and spirit are worn down.
I send you and your family my greetings. Greet your wife and all your relatives in my name.
We consulted together to send someone to Geneva and provided him with letters for Beza. If it is possible, let them make public their confession of faith.
We believe this would be the most appropriate resolution.
 
Dated February 1/3, 1554.
To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Senior Pastor of the Church of Zurich, my esteemed lord and dearest godfather.
