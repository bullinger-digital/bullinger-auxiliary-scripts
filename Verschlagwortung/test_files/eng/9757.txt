July 26, 1574  

Because our sins are so great and unbelievable, and because godless behavior has persisted for such a long time, God has justly visited us with this miserable scourge, this unnoticeable blaze, so that more than half the town burned within an hour and was miserably destroyed by fire by the second day.  

On the 23rd of July, between one and two o'clock, it began behind the merchant house, near the inn called "Zum güldenen Storch." There stood a small black house with a chicken coop and a hay barn nearby, belonging to the inn. A young woman, on the orders of her mistress, was instructed to burn the chicken lice, as the soldiers had to be properly treated, and the hens and roosters were heavily infested with lice.  

The young woman (as the common tale goes) fetched a burning brand from the inn and attempted to burn the pests with a straw brush. The flames, driven by the wind, quickly reached the adjacent hay barn and set the inn ablaze, which spread rapidly. In less than an hour, sparks, carried by the wind, leaped from one roof to another, not only upwards (as is common) but also around in all directions, jumping frantically from one roof to another.  

Everyone initially rushed to the first site of damage, but before many could even reach their own houses, they were already engulfed in red flames. This caused many to recklessly risk their lives by rushing into the fire, some seeking refuge in cellars, thinking they could survive there, only to suffocate, drown, burn, or be miserably destroyed.  

Thirteen bodies were found and buried. Many families were unable to save a single possession and, with their wives and children, have fallen from wealth into utter poverty. They now wander miserably around hedges and fences. Others, who were already poor, are now begging for anything they can get for God’s sake.  

The general buildings burned include the hospital, the Dominican monastery (where a school had been held), but the churches in use and the armory were spared, although the fire raged near them for a long time. The watchmen, who could estimate the number of burned houses, reported that within the city walls alone, more than 20 houses were destroyed, which accounted for more than half the town.  

Outside the Upper Gate, all houses and barns were burned down except for one barn and house. As soon as the alarm was raised, the neighboring communities, such as Ems, Schalkvik, Cicers, Ygis, and Malans, bravely came to our aid, and through their help, God granted relief.  

Otherwise, as every citizen had to find their own shelter, one can imagine how panicked and confused people must have been in their attempts to fight the fire. The disaster came so quickly and fiercely that neither strength nor assistance could prevent it, and in many places, the fire simply had to be allowed to burn itself out.  

The tower or bell tower where the gunpowder was stored was miraculously spared by God. Although the doors were on fire, no damage occurred, as the city carpenter courageously entered and sprinkled water on the inside doors. These wooden doors were covered externally with iron, and while the wooden structures burned, the iron held.  

There is much suspicion regarding arson, but those who witnessed where and how the fire started, and how the wind spread it rapidly, cannot place much blame on arsonists. Instead, everyone must recognize this as a special act of God’s vengeance and punishment.  

Some are already claiming that the fire was caused by the preachers. However, the fire started right next to the inn, where many of the current officials of the new war effort were lodged, displaying their wealth and extravagance. On the same Friday when the fire broke out, there was drumming, whistling, flag waving, sword fighting, and various reckless behavior day and night. In summary, no foolishness was absent, all of which had to be tolerated patiently. Although such activities were strictly forbidden before, exceptions were made for visiting ambassadors, thereby inviting God's wrath upon us.  

Certain houses, particularly those near the church and rectory, burned with astonishing persistence, smoldering from evening until morning. Even when the fire was extinguished elsewhere, it continued to burn in these locations. This showed that God, in His grace and mercy, wanted to demonstrate His power, as the church and surrounding houses were spared.  

At the Hof, people expected the same fate, so most of the roofs were torn off as a precaution. From each neighboring community, six men were assigned to remain and help maintain order. Even so, we remain anxious and unable to sleep.  

God have mercy on us and protect us from greater suffering. May He awaken compassionate hearts among others so that they may show mercy and aid us in our distress. Amen.
